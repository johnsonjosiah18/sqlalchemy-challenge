# sqlalchemy-challenge

# There are two major portions to this challenge. 


# In the first section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
# It will include precipitation analysis and station analysis that can be found in the "surfer" folder labeled as climate_starter.ipynb.

# In the second part of this challenge, you'll use flask api based on the queries that were created in the climate_starter file. This information will also be located within the surfer file under app.py.
